You can download or create Jekyll plugins to extend the functionality of Jekyll for your site. For example, the [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin lets you use GitHub-flavored emoji in any page on your site the same way you would on GitHub. For more information, see "[Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/)" in the Jekyll documentation.
