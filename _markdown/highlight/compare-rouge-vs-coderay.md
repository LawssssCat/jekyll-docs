List of languages supported by Rouge and CodeRay - <https://www.redmine.org/issues/24681#note-46>

Current syntax highlighter CodeRay does not support popular languages such as C#, Visual Basic, Objective C, Swift, ... and so on. Unfortunately the development of CodeRay is not so active now, it is difficult to expect that CodeRay will support those languages.

On the contrary, [Rouge][ruge-github] supports [100+ languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).
