Jekyll provides a very convenient way to create a static website.

However, the [official website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) information can not satisfy me, and the relevant information is very scattered.
I'm tired of looking around for information about Jekyll. 

Therefore, I want to collect the common information of Jekyll and put all in one site.
